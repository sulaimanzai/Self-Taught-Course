# Self-Taught-Course
This is a little experiment I want to start with. Basically ask claude to give a course on a github project. But basically I get a link to the github project and then upload it as a git page. I'm just bored twin

You can then clone this project and take them offline.

TODOs:
- Exams
- Assignments
- One markdown file for inserting references
